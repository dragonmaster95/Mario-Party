Code Documentation:
==================

Comments:
-----------------

Every file should contain the following comment at the very top:

#
#	<filename>.mcc
#	author: [Author]
#
#	description:
#	[Short description of what the code in the file does]
#
#	instructions:
# 	[If it needs instructions on how to use it, put those here. Optional.]
#


Everything should be commented and explained. comments belong in front of the code they describe.
Try to be as detailed as possible while not stating the obvious.

Example:

	# Comment explaining the following command(s)
	kill @a[name=Panossa]


Indents:
---------------

Use indents as you see fit to group logical elements.

Example:

# part 1
	/command 1
	# comment
	/command 2

# part 2
	/command 3



Case Convention:
================

camelCase 		for everything code-related, like scoreboard objectives, tags and variables
snake_case		for filenames


Tabs:
================

tab = 4 spaces


Naming Conventions:
====================

All variables as well as scoreboard objectives and tags should have reasonable names that reflect their use in some way, following the case conventions.
Make sure to add the prefix to minigame specific things.


Filenames:
=================

every minigame has it's own initials which are also the name for the subfolder in /minigame/.
please use a main.mcfunction as the master function of your minigame, that controlls everything about it and is the only thing needed to be called from the main game function.
